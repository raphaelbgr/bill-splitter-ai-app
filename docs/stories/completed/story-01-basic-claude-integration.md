# Story 1: Basic Claude Integration

**Epic:** Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 8 Story Points
**Dependencies:** None (Foundation story)

---

## Story Description

As a developer, I want to implement basic Claude AI integration with model routing (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) so that the application can respond to Portuguese expense descriptions and provide intelligent bill splitting suggestions.

This story establishes the foundational AI capabilities that will power the entire conversational experience, with a focus on cost optimization and Brazilian market requirements.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Claude API integration is implemented with proper error handling
- [x] Model routing system works (Haiku for simple queries, Sonnet for complex, Opus for advanced)
- [x] Basic Portuguese expense parsing from text input works
- [x] Cost tracking and optimization system is in place
- [x] Claude responds to Portuguese expense descriptions with 80%+ accuracy
- [x] Response times meet targets (<1s Haiku, <2.5s Sonnet, <5s Opus)
- [x] API key management is secure and follows best practices
- [x] Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- [x] Basic conversation flow can handle Portuguese input

---

## Technical Requirements

- [x] Implement Claude API client with TypeScript
- [x] Create model routing logic based on query complexity
- [x] Set up environment variables for API keys
- [x] Implement request/response logging for debugging
- [x] Create cost tracking system for API usage
- [x] Add rate limiting to prevent excessive API calls
- [x] Implement proper error handling for API failures
- [x] Create fallback mechanisms for API downtime
- [x] Set up monitoring for API performance and costs

---

## Brazilian Market Requirements

- [X] Portuguese language support from day one
- [X] Brazilian cultural context understanding (rodízio, happy hour, etc.)
- [X] LGPD-compliant data handling for conversation storage
- [X] Brazilian currency (BRL) support in responses
- [X] Regional Portuguese variations are handled appropriately
- [X] Cost optimization targets Brazilian market budget constraints

---

## Definition of Done

- [X] Claude API integration is fully functional
- [X] Model routing system works correctly
- [X] Portuguese expense parsing achieves 80%+ accuracy
- [X] Cost tracking system provides real-time monitoring
- [X] Response times meet all performance targets
- [X] Error handling covers all common failure scenarios
- [X] Security measures are implemented and tested
- [X] Documentation is complete for the integration
- [X] Code review is completed and approved
- [X] Basic conversation flow is tested with Brazilian users

---

## Success Gates

**Primary Success Gate:** Claude responds to Portuguese expense descriptions with intelligent splitting suggestions.

**Secondary Success Gates:**
- Model routing optimizes costs while maintaining quality
- Response times meet performance targets
- Error handling ensures graceful degradation
- Cost tracking provides visibility into API usage

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Claude API costs exceeding budget
- **Mitigation:** Implement intelligent model routing and usage limits
- **Rollback Plan:** Fallback to basic mathematical calculations

**Secondary Risk:** Portuguese parsing accuracy below targets
- **Mitigation:** Extensive testing with Brazilian expense scenarios
- **Rollback Plan:** Manual correction options for users

---

## Implementation Notes

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet as primary model for balance of cost/quality
- Implement caching for repeated queries to reduce costs
- Store conversation context in Redis for performance
- Use environment variables for all API configuration

**Brazilian Market Considerations:**
- Test with real Brazilian expense scenarios
- Ensure cultural context is properly understood
- Validate Portuguese language processing accuracy
- Monitor costs closely for Brazilian market constraints

---

## Testing Requirements

- [X] Unit tests for Claude API integration
- [X] Integration tests for model routing
- [X] Performance tests for response times
- [X] Cost optimization tests
- [X] Portuguese language accuracy tests
- [X] Error handling tests
- [X] Security tests for API key management

---

## Documentation Requirements

- [X] API integration documentation
- [X] Model routing logic documentation
- [X] Cost optimization guidelines
- [X] Error handling procedures
- [X] Security best practices
- [X] Brazilian market testing results
