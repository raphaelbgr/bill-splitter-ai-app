## Implementation Notes

### Dev Agent Record

**Completion Date:** December 2024
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Supabase project configured in São Paulo region
- ✅ Complete database schema with 13 tables implemented
- ✅ All RLS policies working correctly (no recursion issues)
- ✅ LGPD compliance features implemented
- ✅ Brazilian market requirements met
- ✅ Authentication system functional
- ✅ Claude API integration working
- ✅ All environment variables configured

**Database Tables Created:**
- user_profiles (with CPF, Brazilian fields)
- groups (bill splitting groups)
- group_members (many-to-many relationship)
- conversations (AI chat history)
- messages (conversation messages)
- expenses (bills to split)
- expense_participants (who owes what)
- settlements (debt resolution)
- consent_records (LGPD compliance)
- data_access_log (LGPD compliance)
- processing_records (LGPD compliance)
- daily_costs (performance tracking)
- performance_metrics (analytics)

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration
- `components/AuthForm.tsx` - Authentication component
- `lib/user-service.ts` - User management service
- `pages/auth-test.tsx` - Authentication test page
- `scripts/*.js` - Various setup and test scripts
- `docs/architecture/story-2-database-schema-fixed.sql` - Database schema
- `docs/development/supabase-setup-guide.md` - Setup documentation

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Environment Variables: All configured
- ✅ Supabase Connection: Working
- ✅ Database Schema: All 13 tables accessible
- ✅ Claude API: Connected and working
- ✅ RLS Policies: Fixed and functional

**Next Steps:**
- Ready for Story 3: Basic Conversation Flow
- Application can be tested at: http://localhost:3000/auth-test

---
**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Use Supabase Auth for user management
- Implement Row Level Security for data protection
- Store sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Use Brazilian region for all data storage
- Implement proper data retention policies

**LGPD Compliance Requirements:**
- User consent tracking for all data collection
- Right to data portability (export functionality)
- Right to be forgotten (deletion functionality)
- Data minimization principles
- Purpose limitation for data usage
- Transparency in data processing

---

## Database Schema

**Core Tables:**
```sql
-- Users table with LGPD compliance
users (
  id uuid primary key,
  email text unique,
  phone text,
  cpf_cnpj text,
  consent_given boolean default false,
  consent_date timestamp,
  data_retention_until timestamp,
  created_at timestamp,
  updated_at timestamp
)

-- Conversations table with privacy controls
conversations (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id uuid references users(id),
  content text,
  processed_at timestamp,
  retention_until timestamp,
