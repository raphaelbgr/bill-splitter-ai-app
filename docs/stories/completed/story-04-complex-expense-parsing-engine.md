## Story Description

As a user, I want the AI to understand complex Portuguese expense descriptions with Brazilian cultural context so that I can describe any expense scenario naturally and get accurate splitting suggestions.

## Implementation Notes

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for complex Portuguese processing
- Implement cultural context training with Brazilian scenarios
- Create regional Portuguese variation support

- Use context-aware splitting algorithms

**Brazilian Cultural Contexts:**
- **Rodízio:** All participants pay equal amounts
- **Happy Hour:** Often split equally or by consumption
- **Churrasco:** Usually split by family/group
- **Vaquinha:** Group contribution scenarios
- **Aniversário:** Birthday party expense splitting
- **Viagem:** Travel expense management

---

## Cultural Pattern Recognition

**Brazilian Expense Patterns:**
- **Equal Split:** "Cada um paga igual"
- **By Consumption:** "Cada um paga o que consumiu"
- **Host Pays:** "Eu pago, depois acertamos"
- **Group Contribution:** "Vamos fazer uma vaquinha"
- **Family Split:** "Divide por família"

**Regional Variations:**
- **São Paulo:** More formal, business-like splitting
- **Rio de Janeiro:** More casual, social splitting
- **Nordeste:** Family-oriented, group-focused splitting
- **Sul:** More individualistic, precise splitting
