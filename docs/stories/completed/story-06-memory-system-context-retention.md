**Epic:** Epic 2: Core Conversational Experience
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 6 Story Points
**Dependencies:** Story 2 (Supabase Setup), Story 5 (Group Management)
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## Story Description

As a user, I want the system to remember my groups, preferences, and conversation context across sessions so that I can have continuous, personalized experiences while maintaining full LGPD compliance.

This story implements conversation memory with LGPD compliance, user preference learning, and context-aware expense splitting that respects Brazilian privacy requirements.
